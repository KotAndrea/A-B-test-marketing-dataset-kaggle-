# A/B Testing in Python: Marketing Conversion Analysis

This project explores the impact of ad exposure on user conversion using a kaggle marketing dataset. It applies statistical testing—including Welch’s t-test and Chi-squared tests—to uncover meaningful insights about user behavior.

## Objectives
- Determine whether ad exposure influences conversion rates
- Compare mean ad impressions between converted and non-converted users
- Investigate temporal patterns (day/hour) in ad exposure and conversion

## Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Welch’s t-test for mean comparison (robust to unequal variances and sample sizes)
- Chi-squared test for categorical associations
- Visual inspection of distributions and group differences
- Central Limit Theorem justification for parametric testing

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
